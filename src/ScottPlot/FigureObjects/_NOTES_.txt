FigureObjects is an experimental namespace.

My thought is to make FigureObjects similar to Plottables, but they descrbe things that are not user-provided plottable data.

Storing drawing code for these objects here we can greatly simply the render loop (which currently contains
code to do things like draw axis labels and ticks, greatly complicating it).
